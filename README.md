I'm Nika ðŸ‘‹, a data leader leveraging data science, predictive modeling, and storytelling to provide business insights and solve complex engineering problems. My formal education in Aerospace Engineering has created the baseline for how I approach solving problems â€“ expecting obstacles and formulating a system to overcome them. Here you'll find a compilation of notebooks I created for data analysis & the exploration of machine learning algorithms.
